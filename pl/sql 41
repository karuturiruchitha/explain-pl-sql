What is PL/SQL means 
Oracle PL/SQL is an extension of SQL language.
That combines the data manipulation power of SQL with the processing power of procedural language ,to create super powerful SQL queries. 
PL/SQL ensures seamless processing of SQL statements by enhancing the security, portability, and robustness of the Database.


PL/SQL Full Form
PL/SQL stands for “Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language.” 
PL/SQL is Oracle Corporation’s procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. 
It is a high-performance, highly integrated database language.


The PL/SQL architecture mainly consists of following three components:
-PL/SQL Block
-PL/SQL Engine
-Database Server

----PL/SQL block:

This is the component which has the actual PL/SQL code.
This consists of different sections to divide the code logically (declarative section for declaring purpose, execution section for processing statements, exception handling section for handling errors)
It also contains the SQL instruction that used to interact with the database server.
All the PL/SQL units are treated as PL/SQL blocks, and this is the starting stage of the architecture which serves as the primary input.

-----PL/SQL Engine

PL/SQL engine is the component where the actual processing of the codes takes place.
PL/SQL engine separates PL/SQL units and SQL part in the input (as shown in the image below).
The separated PL/SQL units will be handled by the PL/SQL engine itself.
The SQL part will be sent to database server where the actual interaction with database takes place.
It can be installed in both database server and in the application server.

------Database Server:


This is the most important component of Pl/SQL unit which stores the data.
The PL/SQL engine uses the SQL from PL/SQL units to interact with the database server.
It consists of SQL executor which parses the input SQL statements and execute the same.
