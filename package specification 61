--------Package Specification
Package specification consists of a declaration of all the public variables, cursors, objects, procedures, functions, and exception.

Below are few characteristics of the Package specification.

The elements which are all declared in the specification can be accessed from outside of the package. Such elements are known as a public element.
The package specification is a standalone element that means it can exist alone without package body.
Whenever a package has referred an instance of the package is created for that particular session.
After the instance is created for a session, all the package elements that are initiated in that instance are valid until the end of the session.
