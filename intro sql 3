SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL lets you access and manipulate databases. 
SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, 
and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
The basic use of SQL for data professionals and SQL users is to insert, update, and delete the data from the relational database. 
SQL allows the data professionals and users to retrieve the data from the relational database management systems.
It also helps them to describe the structured data.
 Five types of SQL queries are 
 1) Data Definition Language (DDL) 
 2) Data Manipulation Language (DML) 
 3) Data Control Language(DCL) 
 4) Transaction Control Language(TCL) and, 
 5) Data Query Language (DQL).
