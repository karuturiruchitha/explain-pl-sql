The term "relational database" was first defined by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970.
Codd introduced the term in his research paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".
In this paper and later papers, he defined what he meant by "relational".
One well-known definition of what constitutes a relational database system is composed of Codd's 12 rules.
The most common definition of an RDBMS is a product that presents a view of data as a collection of rows and columns, even if it is not based strictly upon relational theory.
By this definition, RDBMS products typically implement some but not all of Codd's 12 rules.
A second school of thought argues that if a database does not implement all of Codd's rules (or the current understanding on the relational model, as expressed by Christopher J. Date, Hugh Darwen and others), it is not relational. 
This view, shared by many theorists and other strict adherents to Codd's principles, would disqualify most DBMSs as not relational.
For clarification, they often refer to some RDBMSs as truly-relational database management systems (TRDBMS), naming others pseudo-relational database management systems (PRDBMS).
