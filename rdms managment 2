A relational database management system (RDBMS or just RDB) is a common type of database that stores data in tables, 
so it can be used in relation to other stored datasets.
Most databases used by businesses these days are relational databases, as opposed to a flat file or hierarchical database.
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is an information management system that is oriented on a data model. 
Here all the information is properly stored as tables. 
RDBMS Example systems are SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.
Features of a relational database. Relational databases need ACID characteristics.
ACID refers to four essential properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 
These features are the key difference between a relational database and a non-relational database.
