Founding of Oracle. In 1977, Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, 
and Ed Oates started the consultancy Software Development Laboratories, which became Relational Software, Inc. (RSI). 
In 1983, RSI became Oracle Systems Corporation and then later Oracle Corporation. 
First commercially available RDBMS.
Oracle RAC provides software for clustering and high availability in Oracle database environments.
It provides clustering by allowing multiple computers to run Oracle RDBMS simultaneously while accessing a single database.
An Oracle instance consists of three main parts: System Global Area (SGA), Program Global Area (PGA), and background processes. 
The SGA is a shared memory structure allocated when the instance started up and released when it is shut down.
There are three major structures in Oracle Database server architecture: 
--memory structures,
--process structures, and 
--storage structures. 
A basic Oracle database system consists of an Oracle database and a database instance. 
The database consists of both physical structures and logical structures.
