---Create a database connection

---Before you create a database connection, the following prerequisites must be met:

The appropriate connector must be added before you can create a database connection. 
For more information, see Required vendor files and Manage connector types.
You must have the appropriate privileges to the database you want to connect to. 
If you do not have database privileges, contact the database administrator.
You must be able to authenticate the connection. For most databases, a username and password are used for authentication. 
SQL Server and BigQuery use the following alternate authentication methods:
SQL Server can use either SQL Server authentication (username and password) or OS authentication. 
For more information, see Enable OS authentication.
BigQuery uses service account authentication. 
For more information, see Create a service account and private key.
