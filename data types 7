-------SQL Data Types

Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. 
The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, 
and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.


----SQL data types can be broadly divided into following categories.

-Numeric data types such as int, tinyint, bigint, float, real, etc.
-Date and Time data types such as Date, Time, Datetime, etc.
-Character and String data types such as char, varchar, text, etc.
-Unicode character string data types, for example nchar, nvarchar, ntext, etc.
-Binary data types such as binary, varbinary, etc.
-Miscellaneous data types - clob, blob, xml, cursor, table, etc.


----SQL Data Types important points


Not all data types are supported by every relational database vendor. 
For example, Oracle database doesn’t support DATETIME and MySQL doesn’t support CLOB data type. 
So while designing database schema and writing SQL queries, make sure to check if the data types are supported or not.
Data types listed here doesn’t include all the data types, these are the most popularly used data types. 
Some relational database vendors have their own data types that might be not listed here. 
For example, Microsoft SQL Server has money and smallmoney data types but since it’s not supported by other popular database vendors, it’s not listed here.
Every relational database vendor has its own maximum size limit for different data types, you don’t need to remember the limit. 
Idea is to have the knowledge of what data type to be used in a specific scenario.
