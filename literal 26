------What are literal values means
Literal values (constants) are exact values (alphabetic or numeric). 
These values are also the constants that you use in expressions, 
such as the numeric value 100, or the string "John Smith".

String Literals
String literals are always surrounded by single quotes (').
For example:

'TechOnTheNet.com'
'This is a literal'
'XYZ'
'123'


--------Integer Literals
Integer literals can be either positive numbers or negative numbers, but do not contain decimals. 
If you do not specify a sign, then a positive number is assumed. Here are some examples of valid integer literals:

500
+500
-500


--------Decimal Literals
Decimal literals can be either positive numbers or negative numbers and contain decimals. 
If you do not specify a sign, then a positive number is assumed. Here are some examples of valid decimal literals:

24.9
+24.9
-24.9


--------Datetime Literals
Datetime literals are character representations of datetime values that are enclosed in single quotes.

'April 30, 2015'
'2015/09/30'
'2015/09/30 08:34:25'
