A PL/SQL procedure is a reusable unit that encapsulates specific business logic of the application. 
Technically speaking, a PL/SQL procedure is a named block stored as a schema object in the Oracle Database.


The following illustrates the basic syntax of creating a procedure in PL/SQL:

CREATE [OR REPLACE ] PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameter_list)     
IS
    
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
[declaration statements]

BEGIN

[execution statements]

EXCEPTION

[exception handler]

END [procedure_name ];





CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE p_contact(
    in_customer_id NUMBER 
)
IS
  r_contact contacts%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  -- get contact based on customer id
  SELECT *
  INTO r_contact
  FROM contacts
  WHERE customer_id = p_customer_id;

  -- print out contact's information
  dbms_output.put_line( r_contact.first_name || ' ' ||
  r_contact.last_name || '<' || r_contact.email ||'>' );

EXCEPTION
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
      dbms_output.put_line( SQLERRM );
END;
