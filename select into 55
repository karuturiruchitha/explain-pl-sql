PL/SQL SELECT INTO statement is the simplest and fastest way to fetch a single row from a table into variables. 


DECLARE
  l_customer_name customers.name%TYPE;
BEGIN
  -- get name of the customer 100 and assign it to l_customer_name
  SELECT name INTO l_customer_name
  FROM customers
  WHERE customer_id = 100;
  -- show the customer name
  dbms_output.put_line( v_customer_name );
END;
