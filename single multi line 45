------Single-line comments
A single-line comment starts with a double hyphen ( --) that can appear anywhere on a line and extends to the end of the line.

For example, the following single-line comment explains the meaning of the co_vat_rate constant:

-- valued added tax 10%
DECLARE co_vat_rate CONSTANT NUMBER := 0.1; 

UPDATE products SET list_price = 0; -- WHERE product_id = l_id;


----------Multi-line comments
A multi-line comment starts with a slash-asterisk ( /* ) and ends with an asterisk-slash ( */ ), and can span multiple lines:

/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  that can span multiple lines
*/

DECLARE
    l_customer_name customers.name%TYPE;
    l_credit_limit customers.credit_limit%TYPE;
BEGIN
   ...
END;
