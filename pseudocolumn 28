Pseudocolumn: A pseudo-column behaves like a table column but is not actually stored in the table. 
You can select from pseudo-columns, but you cannot insert, update, or delete their values. 
A pseudo-column is also similar to a function without arguments. This section describes these pseudo-columns: 
-CURRVAL and NEXTVAL
-LEVEL
-ROWID
-ROWNUM


USE DataFlair;
SELECT * FROM Location;

INSERT INTO tableName VALUES (sequence.Nextval(),value1,value2,....);


USE DataFlair;
INSERT INTO location VALUES (location_id.Nextval(),'Noida',5);
SELECT * from the location;
