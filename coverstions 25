-----Implicit Data Type Conversion
A VARCHAR2 or CHAR value can be implicitly converted to NUMBER or DATE type value by Oracle. 
Similarly, a NUMBER or DATA type value can be automatically converted to character data by Oracle server. 

SELECT employee_id,first_name,salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 19000;


-----Explicit Data Type Conversion
SQL Conversion functions are single row functions which are capable of typecasting column value, literal or an expression . 
TO_CHAR, TO_NUMBER and TO_DATE are the three functions which perform cross modification of data types.


SELECT first_name,
       TO_CHAR (hire_date, 'MONTH DD, YYYY') HIRE_DATE,
	   TO_CHAR (salary, '$99999.99') Salary
FROM employees
WHERE rownum < 8;
