-------------What are triggers in sql is
Triggers are procedures that are stored in the database and implicitly run, or fired, when something happens. 
Traditionally, triggers supported the execution of a PL/SQL block when an INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE occurred on a table or view.
Triggers in oracle are blocks of PL/SQL code which oracle engine can execute automatically based on some action or event.
These events can be:
-DDL statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE)
-DML statements (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
-Database operation like connecting or disconnecting to oracle (LOGON, LOGOFF, SHUTDOWN)



create or replace trigger emp_trig
before insert on emp
for each row
begin
if :new.deptno = 79 then
:new.comm := :new.sal* .5;
end if;
end;
