Logical storage structures are managed and handled only by Oracle Database. 
An operating system cannot see them. 
All logical structures are stored in a database logical space like data blocks, extents, segments and tablespaces.
Physical structures are those that can be seen and operated on from the operating system, such as the physical files that store data on disk. 
Logical structures are created and recognized by the Oracle database server and are not known to the operating system.
The structure of a logical database is usually based on the foreign key relationships between hierarchical tables in the SAPSystem. 
Logical databases have a tree-like structure.
There is a single node at the highest level. 
This is known as the root node.
Two kinds of storage structures are familiar from everyday life:
---stack 
---queue.
