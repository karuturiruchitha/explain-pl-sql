A mutating table error (ORA-04091) occurs when a row-level trigger tries to examine or change a table that is already undergoing change 
(via an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement). 
In particular, this error occurs when a row-level trigger attempts to read or write the table from which the trigger was fired.
