----What is INTERVAL in SQL is
Measures the difference between two points in time. 
Intervals can be positive or negative. 
The INTERVAL data type is SQL:2008 compliant,
and supports interval qualifiers that are divided into two major subtypes:
Year-month: Span of years and months.

----We can use the following syntax to create an interval value:

INTERVAL expr unit  

INTERVAL 2 DAY  


mysql> SELECT '2020-02-01' + INTERVAL 5 DAY AS DATE;  


mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD('2020-02-01', INTERVAL 3 MONTH) AS MONTH_LATER,   
DATE_SUB('2020-02-01',INTERVAL 3 MONTH) AS MONTH_BEFORE;
