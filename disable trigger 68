Disabling Triggers
Consider temporarily disabling a trigger if one of the following conditions is true:
An object that the trigger references is not available.
You must perform a large data load and want it to proceed quickly without firing triggers.
You are loading data into the table to which the trigger applies.

example:

ALTER TABLE orders DISABLE ALL TRIGGERS;
